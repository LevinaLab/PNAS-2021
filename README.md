# Network simulation and analysis for Sukenik et al. 2021
- ABC fit of adLIF network to inter-burst interval statistics
- Code for solving to the mean-field equations

ABC_nuki_fit.py - main script to run ABC on the bursting network
BIC_simuations.py - blocking inhibtion in the fitted network (in silico
bicuculline application)
nuki/ - scripts to parse the fitting results

setup.sh - install NEST and adLIF model on ubuntu
